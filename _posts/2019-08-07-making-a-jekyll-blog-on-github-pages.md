## GitHub Pages
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers a great, free, way of hosting your personal website or blog. Most other free services I've encountered have slow page loading times, 
force you to display heavy advertisging, or give you a really horrible url. GitHub Pages also has the advantage of showing potential employers and recruiters 
that you developed the website yourself, and didn't just throw your content into a website generator.

However, serving a blog using GitHub Pages can be difficult. Blogs often require some basic database system for storing data on the blog post, including information such as:

* Author
* Title
* Images
* Text
* Date

Unfortunately, deploying standard database technologies such as MySQL or MongoDB is not possible on GitHub Pages.
